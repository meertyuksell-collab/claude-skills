# MCP Builder — extended playbook

### Design Agent-Friendly Tool Interfaces

- Choose tool names that are unambiguous — `search_tickets_by_status` not `query`
- Write descriptions that tell the agent *when* to use the tool, not just what it does
- Define typed parameters with Zod (TypeScript) or Pydantic (Python) — every input validated, optional params have sensible defaults
- Return structured data the agent can reason about — JSON for data, markdown for human-readable content

### Build Production-Quality MCP Servers

- Implement proper error handling that returns actionable messages, never stack traces
- Add input validation at the boundary — never trust what the agent sends
- Handle auth securely — API keys from environment variables, OAuth token refresh, scoped permissions
- Design for stateless operation — each tool call is independent, no reliance on call order

### Test with Real Agents

- A tool that passes unit tests but confuses the agent is broken
- Test the full loop: agent reads description → picks tool → sends params → gets result → takes action
- Validate error paths — what happens when the API is down, rate-limited, or returns unexpected data

## 🚨 Critical Rules You Must Follow


1. **Descriptive tool names** — `search_users` not `query1`; agents pick tools by name and description
2. **Typed parameters with Zod/Pydantic** — every input validated, optional params have defaults
3. **Structured output** — return JSON for data, markdown for human-readable content
4. **Fail gracefully** — return error content with `isError: true`, never crash the server
5. **Stateless tools** — each call is independent; don't rely on call order
6. **Environment-based secrets** — API keys and tokens come from env vars, never hardcoded
7. **One responsibility per tool** — `get_user` and `update_user` are two tools, not one tool with a `mode` parameter
8. **Test with real agents** — a tool that looks right but confuses the agent is broken

### TypeScript MCP Server


```typescript
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import { z } from "zod";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "tickets-server",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

// Tool: search tickets with typed params and clear description
server.tool(
  "search_tickets",
  "Search support tickets by status and priority. Returns ticket ID, title, assignee, and creation date.",
  {
    status: z.enum(["open", "in_progress", "resolved", "closed"]).describe("Filter by ticket status"),
    priority: z.enum(["low", "medium", "high", "critical"]).optional().describe("Filter by priority level"),
    limit: z.number().min(1).max(100).default(20).describe("Max results to return"),
  },
  async ({ status, priority, limit }) => {
    try {
      const tickets = await db.tickets.find({ status, priority, limit });
      return {
        content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(tickets, null, 2) }],
      };
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        content: [{ type: "text", text: `Failed to search tickets: ${error.message}` }],
        isError: true,
      };
    }
  }
);

// Resource: expose ticket stats so agents have context before acting
server.resource(
  "ticket-stats",
  "tickets://stats",
  async () => ({
    contents: [{
      uri: "tickets://stats",
      text: JSON.stringify(await db.tickets.getStats()),
      mimeType: "application/json",
    }],
  })
);

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

### MCP Client Configuration


```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tickets": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://localhost:5432/tickets"
      }
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "github_server"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Interface Design

- Name every tool as a verb_noun pair: `create_issue`, `search_users`, `get_deployment_status`
- Write the description first — if you can't explain when to use it in one sentence, split the tool
- Define parameter schemas with types, defaults, and descriptions on every field
- Design return shapes that give the agent enough context to decide its next step

### Step 4: Agent Testing and Iteration

- Connect the server to a real agent and test the full tool-call loop
- Watch for: agent picking the wrong tool, sending bad params, misinterpreting results
- Refine tool names and descriptions based on agent behavior — this is where most bugs live
- Test error paths: API down, invalid credentials, rate limits, empty results

### Composable Server Architecture

- Breaking large integrations into focused single-purpose servers
- Coordinating multiple MCP servers that share context through resources
- Proxy servers that aggregate tools from multiple backends behind one connection
