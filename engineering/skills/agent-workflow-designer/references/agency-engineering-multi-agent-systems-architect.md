## 🚨 Critical Rules You Must Follow

- **Demos lie; production tells the truth.** Never sign off on a pipeline whose failure modes haven't been enumerated with explicit recovery paths. "It worked when I ran it" is not a design.
- **Least privilege, always.** Every agent gets only the tools and data its role requires — nothing more. Scope tokens are never passed between agents.
- **Every agent needs a fallback.** Primary → narrowed fallback → degraded/rule-based → human. The system must always produce *something*; a structured degraded response beats a silent failure.
- **Never silently truncate required context.** If compression can't fit the budget without dropping required fields, halt and escalate — silent truncation is a leading cause of production silent failures.
- **Observability is non-negotiable.** Every agent call emits a structured log with a shared trace_id. If you can't trace a wrong answer back to the agent that caused it, the system isn't production-ready.
- **Default to hierarchical, not mesh.** Peer/mesh networks are the highest-complexity, hardest-to-debug topology — require a moderator and a termination condition, and justify the choice before reaching for it.
- **No deployment without evals.** New or modified agents need an eval suite (≥20 cases), a recorded baseline, a meets-or-exceeds score, and a full-pipeline regression check before shipping.
- **Treat external content as hostile.** Any agent processing web pages, documents, or user input must isolate content from instructions and validate outputs against a schema to defend against prompt injection.

### Pattern 1 — Sequential Chain


```
Input → Agent A → Agent B → Agent C → Output
```

**Use when:**
- Each step depends on the output of the previous step
- Task has a natural linear progression (research → draft → review → publish)
- Debugging simplicity is prioritized over latency

**Failure mode**: Single agent failure halts entire pipeline. Agent C has no visibility into Agent A's reasoning — context loss compounds across hops.

**Design rules:**
- Pass structured outputs between agents, not raw prose (reduces misinterpretation)
- Include a brief "context summary" field each agent appends for downstream agents
- Set maximum chain length: chains >5 agents typically degrade in output quality
- Define what each agent receives, produces, and is NOT responsible for

---

### Pattern 2 — Parallel Fan-Out / Fan-In


```
              ┌→ Agent A ─┐
Input → Router ├→ Agent B ─┤→ Synthesizer → Output
              └→ Agent C ─┘
```

**Use when:**
- Subtasks are independent and can run concurrently
- Latency reduction is a priority
- Multiple perspectives on the same input are valuable (e.g., legal + financial + technical review)

**Failure mode**: Partial results if one agent fails. Synthesizer must handle missing branches gracefully. Race conditions if agents share mutable state.

**Design rules:**
- Agents in a fan-out MUST be truly independent — no shared mutable state
- Synthesizer must explicitly handle: all results present, partial results, zero results
- Define merge strategy before building: vote, weight, concatenate, or defer to human
- Fan-out width limit: >7 parallel agents typically exceeds synthesis quality threshold

---

### Pattern 3 — Hierarchical (Orchestrator-Subagent)


```
                    ┌→ Subagent A
Orchestrator ───────├→ Subagent B
                    └→ Subagent C
         ↑____feedback_____|
```

**Use when:**
- Tasks are complex and require dynamic decomposition
- The set of subtasks isn't known upfront
- Quality control requires a coordinating judgment layer

**Failure mode**: Orchestrator becomes a bottleneck. Orchestrator prompt complexity grows unbounded. Subagents that "succeed" on their local objective but contradict each other.

**Design rules:**
- Orchestrator's job is decomposition, delegation, and synthesis — NOT execution
- Orchestrator must maintain a task ledger: what was delegated, to whom, status, output
- Subagents must return structured results + confidence signal, not just answers
- Orchestrator must detect contradiction between subagent outputs and resolve explicitly
- Limit orchestrator context window consumption: subagent outputs should be summarized, not appended in full

---

### Pattern 5 — Mesh / Peer Network


```
Agent A ⟷ Agent B
  ⟷         ⟷
Agent C ⟷ Agent D
```

**Use when:**
- Agents need to negotiate or reach consensus
- No single agent has sufficient context to make the final decision
- Simulating diverse expert panel deliberation

**Failure mode**: Highest complexity. Circular dependencies. Consensus deadlock. Exponential context growth as agents read each other's outputs. Hard to debug.

**Design rules:**
- Rarely the right choice for production systems — default to hierarchical first
- Require a moderator agent or termination condition (max rounds, consensus threshold)
- Each agent's read access to peer outputs should be scoped: full transcript vs. summary
- Define explicit consensus mechanism: majority, unanimity, weighted by confidence
- Build a circuit breaker: if no consensus after N rounds, escalate to human

---

### The Context Budget Problem


Every agent in a pipeline consumes context. In a 5-agent sequential chain, context pressure compounds:
- Agent A receives: user input (500 tokens)
- Agent B receives: user input + Agent A output (1,500 tokens)
- Agent C receives: prior chain + Agent B output (3,500 tokens)
- Agent D receives: prior chain + Agent C output (7,500 tokens)
- Agent E receives: prior chain + Agent D output (15,000+ tokens)

Context budget exhaustion causes: hallucination, instruction-following failures, truncation of critical early context.

### Context Management Strategies


**1. Summarization Compression**
Each agent produces two outputs: full output + compressed summary (≤200 tokens).
Downstream agents receive summaries of prior steps, not full outputs.
Risk: lossy — critical details may be dropped in summary.
Mitigation: define what fields are always preserved verbatim (IDs, decisions, constraints).

**2. Structured State Object**
Define a shared state schema passed between agents. Each agent reads only its required fields and writes only its output fields.

```json
{
  "task_id": "uuid",
  "original_input": "...",
  "constraints": ["...", "..."],
  "agent_outputs": {
    "researcher": { "summary": "...", "sources": [...], "confidence": 0.85 },
    "analyst": { "findings": "...", "risks": [...] },
    "writer": { "draft": "..." }
  },
  "decisions": [],
  "current_step": "writer",
  "status": "in_progress"
}
```

Each agent receives only the fields relevant to its role — not the full object.

**3. External Memory Store**
Long-form outputs written to external storage (vector DB, key-value store).
Agents retrieve only what they need via targeted lookup, not full context injection.
Use when: pipeline produces large intermediate artifacts (research reports, codebases).

**4. Context Checkpointing**
At defined milestones, compress all prior state into a checkpoint summary.
Agents after the checkpoint receive only the checkpoint + their immediate inputs.
Enables pipelines that would otherwise exceed any context window.

### Failure Taxonomy


| Failure Type | Description | Detection | Recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hard failure** | Agent returns error, exception, or times out | Error code / timeout | Retry with backoff → fallback agent → human escalation |
| **Silent failure** | Agent returns output but it's wrong or hallucinated | Evaluator agent; schema validation | Retry with explicit correction prompt → human review |
| **Partial failure** | Agent returns incomplete output (truncated, missing fields) | Schema validation; completeness check | Request specific missing fields → regenerate |
| **Contradiction** | Two agents return conflicting outputs | Explicit contradiction detector | Arbitration agent → human decision |
| **Cascade failure** | One agent's bad output poisons all downstream agents | Checkpoint validation; anomaly detection | Rollback to last checkpoint; re-run from failure point |
| **Loop failure** | Evaluator-optimizer never converges | Iteration counter; score plateau detection | Force exit; escalate with last best output |
| **Context failure** | Agent ignores instructions due to context overload | Output schema validation; instruction adherence check | Trim context; re-run with compressed state |

### Circuit Breaker Pattern


Apply to any agent that can be called repeatedly (retry loops, optimizer loops):

```
State: CLOSED (normal) → OPEN (failing) → HALF-OPEN (testing recovery)

CLOSED: Requests flow normally. Track failure rate over rolling window.
  → If failure rate > threshold (e.g., 3 failures in 5 attempts): trip to OPEN

OPEN: Requests immediately fail / escalate. Do not call the agent.
  → After cooldown period (e.g., 60 seconds): transition to HALF-OPEN

HALF-OPEN: Allow one test request.
  → If succeeds: return to CLOSED
  → If fails: return to OPEN
```

### Fallback Chain Design


For every agent in a production pipeline, define its fallback:

| Priority | Agent | Condition to Invoke |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (primary) | Full capability agent (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude Opus) | Default |
| 2 (fallback) | Lighter agent with narrowed scope | Primary fails or exceeds latency SLA |
| 3 (degraded) | Rule-based / template output | Fallback also fails |
| 4 (human) | Human review queue | All automated paths fail |

Design rule: the system must always produce *something* — even a "degraded mode" structured response is better than a silent failure.

### Rollback & Recovery


- **Checkpoint frequency**: after every agent that produces irreversible side effects (sends email, writes to DB, calls external API)
- **Idempotency requirement**: any agent that can be retried MUST be idempotent — running it twice must produce the same result or be safe to overwrite
- **Compensation actions**: for non-idempotent actions, define the compensation (e.g., send correction email, delete duplicate record)
- **Recovery point objective**: define how far back the pipeline can safely re-run from

---

### Least-Privilege Principle for Agents


Each agent should have access to only the tools and data it needs — nothing more.

**Tool Access Matrix (example)**

| Agent Role | Web Search | Code Execution | File Write | External API | DB Read | DB Write |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Researcher | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Read-only | ✅ | ❌ |
| Analyst | ❌ | ✅ (sandbox) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Writer | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (drafts only) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Publisher | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ (publish API) | ❌ | ✅ (status only) |
| Orchestrator | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ (task ledger) |

### Agent Authorization Model


**Identity**: Each agent instance has a unique ID and role label. Inter-agent messages must include sender ID — downstream agents validate the source.

**Scope tokens**: Each agent receives a scoped token that grants only its permitted tool access. Tokens are not passed between agents.

**Sandboxing**: Code execution agents run in isolated environments. File system access is restricted to designated directories. Network access is allowlisted, not open.

**Audit log**: Every tool call by every agent is logged with: agent ID, tool name, inputs, outputs, timestamp. Non-negotiable for production systems.

### Prompt Injection Defense


Agents that process external content (web pages, user-submitted documents, emails) are at risk of prompt injection — malicious content that hijacks the agent's instructions.

**Mitigations:**
- Separate content processing from instruction processing: never concatenate external content directly into the system prompt
- Use a "sanitizer" agent whose only job is to extract structured data from untrusted content before passing to downstream agents
- Validate structured outputs with schema enforcement — injected instructions don't produce valid JSON
- Flag and quarantine any agent output that contains instruction-like language (imperative verbs + tool names)

### The Escalation Calibration Problem


**Over-escalation**: humans are interrupted constantly → they start rubber-stamping → HITL becomes theater, not safety.
**Under-escalation**: humans never see edge cases → system builds false confidence → catastrophic failure when it matters.

### HITL Gate Placement Framework


Place a HITL gate when the pipeline action meets one or more of these criteria:

| Criterion | Example | Gate Type |
|---|---|---|
| **Irreversibility** | Send bulk email; delete records; publish content | Blocking approval |
| **High blast radius** | Action affects >100 users / >$10k value | Blocking approval |
| **Low confidence** | Agent confidence score <0.7; contradictory outputs | Blocking review |
| **Novel situation** | Input pattern not seen in eval set; out-of-distribution | Advisory flag |
| **Regulatory exposure** | Output involves legal, medical, or financial advice | Blocking approval |
| **Explicit policy** | Business rule requires human sign-off | Blocking approval |

### Gate Types


**Blocking Approval Gate**
- Pipeline pauses; human receives structured summary with recommended action
- Human approves, rejects, or modifies
- Timeout behavior must be defined: default approve, default reject, or escalate further
- SLA: define maximum wait time before timeout triggers

**Advisory Flag Gate**
- Pipeline continues but flags the action for async human review
- Human can trigger rollback if they catch a problem within review window
- Use when: consequence is reversible; latency of blocking would harm user experience

**Sampling Gate**
- Human reviews X% of outputs randomly (not all)
- Use when: volume is too high for full review; quality monitoring is the goal
- Sampling rate should increase when error rate rises (adaptive sampling)

### HITL Interface Requirements


Every human review interface must show:
- What the agent decided and why (reasoning trace, not just conclusion)
- What alternatives were considered
- What the consequence of approving vs. rejecting is
- How confident the agent was
- One-click approve / reject / escalate — no interface friction

---

### When to Split One Agent Into Two


Split when the agent is doing more than one *distinct cognitive task*:
- Researching AND evaluating AND writing → three agents
- Generating code AND testing it → two agents (generator + tester)
- Translating AND formatting → can stay one if output schema is simple

**Signs an agent is doing too much:**
- System prompt exceeds 1,500 tokens of instructions
- Agent output quality varies dramatically by task type
- Debugging requires distinguishing which "job" failed
- Different stakeholders need to configure different parts of the agent's behavior

### When to Keep One Agent


Keep as one agent when:
- Tasks are tightly coupled (output of step 1 is directly consumed mid-generation by step 2)
- Splitting would require more context transfer overhead than the split saves
- Task is simple enough that splitting adds coordination cost without quality gain

### Minimum Observability Requirements


**Per agent call, log:**
```json
{
  "trace_id": "uuid (shared across entire pipeline run)",
  "span_id": "uuid (this agent call)",
  "agent_id": "researcher_v2",
  "step": 2,
  "started_at": "ISO8601",
  "completed_at": "ISO8601",
  "latency_ms": 1243,
  "input_tokens": 1820,
  "output_tokens": 412,
  "total_cost_usd": 0.0087,
  "input_hash": "sha256 of input (for dedup/cache)",
  "output": { ... },
  "confidence": 0.82,
  "tools_called": ["web_search"],
  "errors": [],
  "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
  "status": "success | failure | partial | escalated"
}
```

**Per pipeline run, log:**
- Total latency; total cost; total tokens
- Which agents ran; which were skipped or failed
- Final output and status
- HITL gates triggered; human decisions made

### Root Cause Analysis Protocol


When a pipeline produces a bad output:

**Step 1 — Identify the blast radius**
Was the bad output a single wrong answer, or did it propagate downstream?

**Step 2 — Trace backward**
Start from the final output. Which agent produced the field that's wrong? Inspect that agent's input and output.

**Step 3 — Isolate the failure**
- If the agent's input was correct but output was wrong → agent failure (prompt, model, or context issue)
- If the agent's input was already wrong → upstream failure; continue tracing backward
- If the agent's input was correct and output was correct but downstream agent misused it → inter-agent contract failure

**Step 4 — Classify the root cause**
- Prompt ambiguity: agent instruction was unclear
- Context overload: agent context window was too full; instructions were deprioritized
- Model limitation: task exceeded model capability; try a stronger model or decompose further
- Schema mismatch: agent produced output that didn't match expected schema; downstream agent misinterpreted
- Missing information: agent didn't have necessary context to complete the task correctly

**Step 5 — Fix and regression test**
Fix the root cause. Add the failing case to your eval set. Run full pipeline eval before redeploying.

---

### Agent-Level Evals


Each agent should have its own eval suite — independent of pipeline evals.

| Eval Type | What It Tests | Method |
|---|---|---|
| **Functional** | Does the agent do its job correctly? | Input/output pairs with known correct answers |
| **Instruction adherence** | Does the agent follow its system prompt constraints? | Adversarial inputs designed to trigger violations |
| **Schema compliance** | Does output consistently match the required schema? | Automated schema validation on 100+ samples |
| **Confidence calibration** | When agent says 0.9 confidence, is it right 90% of the time? | Compare stated confidence to actual accuracy |
| **Edge case handling** | What happens with empty input, malformed input, out-of-domain input? | Boundary and negative test cases |

### Pipeline-Level Evals


| Eval Type | What It Tests |
|---|---|
| **End-to-end accuracy** | Does the pipeline produce the correct final output? |
| **Failure recovery** | Does the pipeline recover correctly when one agent fails? |
| **Cost compliance** | Does the pipeline stay within token/cost budget? |
| **Latency SLA** | Does the pipeline complete within acceptable time? |
| **HITL trigger rate** | Is the escalation rate within expected range (not too high, not too low)? |
| **Regression** | Do previously passing cases still pass after any agent change? |

### Eval-Driven Development Rule


**Never deploy a new agent or modify an existing one without:**
1. An eval suite with ≥20 representative test cases
2. A baseline score on the current version
3. A score on the new version that meets or exceeds baseline
4. A regression check on the full pipeline eval set

---

### Cost Modeling Per Pipeline Run


```
Total cost = Σ (input_tokens × input_price + output_tokens × output_price) per agent call

+ HITL cost (human review time × hourly rate × escalation rate)
+ Infrastructure cost (vector DB reads, external API calls, compute)
```

**Cost per task benchmark targets:**
- Classify this as acceptable before building, not after
- Define hard cost ceiling per run; build circuit breaker that aborts if exceeded
- Track cost per agent as % of total — identify which agents are cost centers

### Latency Optimization Strategies


| Strategy | Latency Reduction | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| Parallelize independent agents | High | Added complexity; requires fan-out/in infrastructure |
| Use faster/smaller model for low-stakes steps | Medium | Potential quality reduction at specific steps |
| Cache common subtask outputs | High | Cache invalidation complexity; stale results risk |
| Streaming output to downstream agents | Medium | Downstream agent starts before upstream finishes — requires partial input handling |
| Reduce context size per agent | Low-Medium | Risk of losing critical context |

### Token Budget Enforcement


Set a hard token budget per agent. If the agent's input would exceed the budget:
1. Attempt context compression (summarize earlier steps)
2. If compression still exceeds budget → truncate least-critical context (with logging)
3. If truncation would remove required fields → halt and escalate

Never silently truncate required context — this is a leading cause of silent failures in production pipelines.
