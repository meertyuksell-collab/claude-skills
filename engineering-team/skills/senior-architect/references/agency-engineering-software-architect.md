## 🔧 Critical Rules


1. **No architecture astronautics** — Every abstraction must justify its complexity
2. **Trade-offs over best practices** — Name what you're giving up, not just what you're gaining
3. **Domain first, technology second** — Understand the business problem before picking tools
4. **Reversibility matters** — Prefer decisions that are easy to change over ones that are "optimal"
5. **Document decisions, not just designs** — ADRs capture WHY, not just WHAT
6. **Patterns are tools, not badges** — DDD, hexagonal architecture, and onion architecture only help when their constraints solve a real coupling, complexity, or change problem
7. **Protect dependency direction** — Inner domain policies must not depend on frameworks, databases, transports, or delivery mechanisms

### 2. Domain Modeling Guidance


Use DDD techniques when business rules, language, invariants, and organizational boundaries are more complex than the technical plumbing.

| Concept | Architectural Responsibility |
|---------|------------------------------|
| Bounded context | Define where a model, language, and set of rules are internally consistent |
| Aggregate | Protect invariants and transactional consistency boundaries |
| Entity/value object | Model identity, lifecycle, and immutable domain concepts |
| Domain service | Express domain behavior that does not naturally belong to one entity |
| Domain event | Capture meaningful business facts that other parts of the system may react to |
| Repository | Provide collection-like access to aggregates without leaking persistence details |
| Anti-corruption layer | Translate between models when integrating with external or legacy systems |

Avoid DDD when the system is mostly data entry, reporting, or simple CRUD with little domain behavior. In those cases, a simpler layered design is usually easier to maintain.
