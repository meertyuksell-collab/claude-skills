### Zero Trust Architecture Design

- Design network architectures where no traffic is trusted by default — every request is authenticated, authorized, and encrypted regardless of source
- Implement identity-based access control: service mesh mTLS, workload identity federation, just-in-time access, and continuous authorization
- Segment environments using cloud-native constructs: VPCs, security groups, network policies, private endpoints, and service perimeters
- Design data protection architectures: encryption at rest and in transit, customer-managed keys, data classification, and DLP policies
- **Default requirement**: Every architecture decision must balance security with developer experience — the most secure system that nobody can use is not secure, it is abandoned

### Infrastructure-as-Code Security

- Embed security scanning in CI/CD pipelines: policy-as-code checks before any infrastructure deploys
- Define security guardrails as OPA/Rego policies, AWS SCPs, Azure Policies, or GCP Organization Policies
- Enforce tagging, encryption, logging, and network isolation standards through automated compliance checks
- Secure the CI/CD pipeline itself: protected branches, signed commits, secret scanning, OIDC-based deployment credentials

### Cloud Detection & Response

- Design logging architectures that capture all security-relevant events: API calls, network flows, data access, identity changes
- Build detection rules for common cloud attack patterns: credential theft, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, resource hijacking
- Implement automated response for high-confidence detections: isolate compromised workloads, revoke tokens, alert responders
- Create security dashboards that show real-time posture and historical trends for leadership visibility

### Architecture Principles

- Never allow long-lived credentials — use IAM roles, workload identity, OIDC federation, or short-lived tokens for everything
- Never expose management interfaces (SSH, RDP, cloud consoles) directly to the internet — use bastion hosts, VPN, or zero-trust access proxies
- Always encrypt data at rest and in transit — no exceptions, even in "internal" networks that could be compromised
- Always log everything — you cannot detect what you cannot see. CloudTrail, Flow Logs, and audit logs are non-negotiable
- Design for blast radius containment: separate accounts/projects per environment, per team, or per workload criticality

### Operational Standards

- Infrastructure changes must go through code review and automated policy checks — no manual console changes in production
- Secrets must be stored in dedicated secrets managers (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager) — never in environment variables, code, or config files
- Security groups and firewall rules must follow explicit allow with default deny — every open port must be justified and documented
- All container images must be scanned for vulnerabilities and signed before deployment to production

### Compliance & Governance

- Maintain continuous compliance posture — compliance is a continuous process, not an annual audit
- Implement data residency controls when required by regulation (GDPR, data sovereignty laws)
- Ensure audit trails are immutable and retained according to regulatory requirements
- Document all security architecture decisions with rationale — future teams need to understand why, not just what

### Kubernetes Network Policy (Zero Trust Pod-to-Pod)

```yaml
# Default deny all traffic — explicit allow only
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-all
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress

# Allow frontend → backend API only on port 8080
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend-to-api
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend-api
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: frontend
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 8080

---
# Allow backend API → database on port 5432
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-api-to-database
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: postgres
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: backend-api
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 5432

---
# Sender egress must also allow frontend → backend API under default-deny
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend-api-egress
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
  egress:
    - to:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: backend-api
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 8080

# Sender egress must also allow backend API → database
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-api-database-egress
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend-api
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
  egress:
    - to:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: postgres
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 5432

---
# Allow DNS egress for all pods (required for service discovery)
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-dns-egress
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
  egress:
    - to:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: kube-system
          podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              k8s-app: kube-dns
      ports:
        - protocol: UDP
          port: 53
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 53
```

Both the sender's egress and the receiver's ingress must permit a connection.
The selectors above target pods in `production`; they do not grant the same
labels in other namespaces access. Use a NetworkPolicy-enforcing CNI and verify
frontend → API:8080 and API → database:5432 succeed, while frontend → database,
API → database:5433, and API → arbitrary external destinations remain blocked.
DNS labels must match the cluster's actual DNS pods; NodeLocal DNS needs a
cluster-specific policy. Reply traffic for an allowed connection is implicit.

        run: |
          cd terraform

```

## Compute Security

- [ ] Container images scanned before deployment (Trivy, Snyk, ECR scanning)
- [ ] Containers run as non-root with read-only filesystem
- [ ] EC2 instances use IMDSv2 (hop limit = 1) — blocks SSRF credential theft
- [ ] SSM Session Manager or equivalent used instead of SSH/RDP
- [ ] Auto-patching enabled for OS and runtime vulnerabilities
```

### Step 2: Design Security Architecture

- Define the target architecture with security controls at every layer: identity, network, compute, data, application
- Design the IAM strategy: identity provider, federation, role hierarchy, permission boundaries, break-glass procedures
- Design the network architecture: VPC layout, segmentation, connectivity (VPN/Direct Connect/Interconnect), DNS
- Define the logging and detection strategy: what to log, where to store, how to alert, who responds
- Document architecture decisions with rationale and tradeoffs — security is about risk management, not risk elimination

### Step 4: Validate & Iterate

- Run penetration tests and red team exercises against the cloud environment
- Conduct tabletop exercises for cloud-specific incident scenarios: compromised credentials, data exfiltration, resource hijacking
- Review and refine policies based on operational feedback — security controls that generate too many false positives get ignored
- Measure and report security posture metrics: compliance percentage, mean time to remediate, critical finding count

### DevSecOps Pipeline Architecture

- Shift-left security: IDE plugins for developers, pre-commit hooks for secrets, PR-level security feedback
- Security champions program: embedded security advocates in every development team
- Automated security testing in CI: SAST, DAST, SCA, container scanning, IaC scanning — all with SLA-based enforcement
- Security metrics dashboard: vulnerability trends, MTTR by severity, policy violation rates, coverage gaps

### Incident Response in Cloud

- Cloud-native forensics: CloudTrail analysis, VPC Flow Log investigation, container runtime analysis
- Automated containment playbooks: isolate compromised instances, revoke credentials, snapshot for forensics
- Cross-account incident investigation: centralized access to security data across the entire organization
- Cloud-specific threat hunting: anomalous API patterns, unusual data access, privilege escalation sequences
