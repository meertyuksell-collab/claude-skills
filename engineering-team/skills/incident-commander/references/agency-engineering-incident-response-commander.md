# Incident Response Commander — extended playbook

> Merged from [The Agency](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents) agent `engineering/engineering-incident-response-commander.md` (MIT License, © AgentLand Contributors).
> Only sections that add something this skill did not already cover are kept; persona, generic metrics and duplicate material were removed.

### During Active Incidents

- Never skip severity classification — it determines escalation, communication cadence, and resource allocation
- Always assign explicit roles before diving into troubleshooting — chaos multiplies without coordination
- Communicate status updates at fixed intervals, even if the update is "no change, still investigating"
- Document actions in real-time — a Slack thread or incident channel is the source of truth, not someone's memory
- Timebox investigation paths: if a hypothesis isn't confirmed in 15 minutes, pivot and try the next one

### Blameless Culture

- Never frame findings as "X person caused the outage" — frame as "the system allowed this failure mode"
- Focus on what the system lacked (guardrails, alerts, tests) rather than what a human did wrong
- Treat every incident as a learning opportunity that makes the entire organization more resilient
- Protect psychological safety — engineers who fear blame will hide issues instead of escalating them

### Operational Discipline

- Runbooks must be tested quarterly — an untested runbook is a false sense of security
- On-call engineers must have the authority to take emergency actions without multi-level approval chains
- Never rely on a single person's knowledge — document tribal knowledge into runbooks and architecture diagrams
- SLOs must have teeth: when the error budget is burned, feature work pauses for reliability work

### Option A: Rollback (preferred if deploy-related)

```bash
# Identify the last known good revision
kubectl rollout history deployment/<service> -n production

# Rollback to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/<service> -n production

# Verify rollback succeeded
kubectl rollout status deployment/<service> -n production
watch kubectl get pods -n production -l app=<service>
```

### Option B: Restart (if state corruption suspected)

```bash
# Rolling restart — maintains availability
kubectl rollout restart deployment/<service> -n production

# Monitor restart progress
kubectl rollout status deployment/<service> -n production
```

### Option C: Scale up (if capacity-related)

```bash
# Increase replicas to handle load
kubectl scale deployment/<service> -n production --replicas=<target>

# Enable HPA if not active
kubectl autoscale deployment/<service> -n production \
  --min=3 --max=20 --cpu-percent=70
```

## Timeline (UTC)

| Time  | Event                                           |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 14:02 | Monitoring alert fires: API error rate > 5%      |
| 14:05 | On-call engineer acknowledges page               |
| 14:08 | Incident declared SEV2, IC assigned              |
| 14:12 | Root cause hypothesis: bad config deploy at 13:55|
| 14:18 | Config rollback initiated                        |
| 14:23 | Error rate returning to baseline                 |
| 14:30 | Incident resolved, monitoring confirms recovery  |
| 14:45 | All-clear communicated to stakeholders           |

## Action Items

| ID | Action                                     | Owner       | Priority | Due Date   | Status      |
|----|---------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|------------|-------------|
| 1  | Add integration test for config validation  | @eng-team   | P1       | YYYY-MM-DD | Not Started |
| 2  | Set up canary deploy for config changes     | @platform   | P1       | YYYY-MM-DD | Not Started |
| 3  | Update runbook with new diagnostic steps    | @on-call    | P2       | YYYY-MM-DD | Not Started |
| 4  | Add config rollback automation              | @platform   | P2       | YYYY-MM-DD | Not Started |

### On-Call Rotation Configuration

```yaml
# PagerDuty / Opsgenie On-Call Schedule Design
schedule:
  name: "backend-primary"
  timezone: "UTC"
  rotation_type: "weekly"
  handoff_time: "10:00"  # Handoff during business hours, never at midnight
  handoff_day: "monday"

  participants:
    min_rotation_size: 4      # Prevent burnout — minimum 4 engineers
    max_consecutive_weeks: 2  # No one is on-call more than 2 weeks in a row
    shadow_period: 2_weeks    # New engineers shadow before going primary

  escalation_policy:
    - level: 1
      target: "on-call-primary"
      timeout: 5_minutes
    - level: 2
      target: "on-call-secondary"
      timeout: 10_minutes
    - level: 3
      target: "engineering-manager"
      timeout: 15_minutes
    - level: 4
      target: "vp-engineering"
      timeout: 0  # Immediate — if it reaches here, leadership must be aware

  compensation:
    on_call_stipend: true              # Pay people for carrying the pager
    incident_response_overtime: true   # Compensate after-hours incident work
    post_incident_time_off: true       # Mandatory rest after long SEV1 incidents

  health_metrics:
    track_pages_per_shift: true
    alert_if_pages_exceed: 5           # More than 5 pages/week = noisy alerts, fix the system
    track_mttr_per_engineer: true
    quarterly_on_call_review: true     # Review burden distribution and alert quality
```

### Cross-Organizational Incident Coordination

- Coordinate multi-team incidents with clear ownership boundaries and communication bridges
- Manage vendor/third-party escalation during cloud provider or SaaS dependency outages
- Build joint incident response procedures with partner companies for shared-infrastructure incidents
- Establish unified status page and customer communication standards across business units
