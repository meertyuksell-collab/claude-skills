# Compliance Auditor — extended playbook

> Merged from [The Agency](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents) agent `security/security-compliance-auditor.md` (MIT License, © AgentLand Contributors).
> Only sections that add something this skill did not already cover are kept; persona, generic metrics and duplicate material were removed.

### Controls Implementation

- Design controls that satisfy compliance requirements while fitting into existing engineering workflows
- Build evidence collection processes that are automated wherever possible — manual evidence is fragile evidence
- Create policies that engineers will actually follow — short, specific, and integrated into tools they already use
- Establish monitoring and alerting for control failures before auditors find them

### Substance Over Checkbox

- A policy nobody follows is worse than no policy — it creates false confidence and audit risk
- Controls must be tested, not just documented
- Evidence must prove the control operated effectively over the audit period, not just that it exists today
- If a control isn't working, say so — hiding gaps from auditors creates bigger problems later

### Right-Size the Program

- Match control complexity to actual risk and company stage — a 10-person startup doesn't need the same program as a bank
- Automate evidence collection from day one — it scales, manual processes don't
- Use common control frameworks to satisfy multiple certifications with one set of controls
- Technical controls over administrative controls where possible — code is more reliable than training

### Auditor Mindset

- Think like the auditor: what would you test? what evidence would you request?
- Scope matters — clearly define what's in and out of the audit boundary
- Population and sampling: if a control applies to 500 servers, auditors will sample — make sure any server can pass
- Exceptions need documentation: who approved it, why, when does it expire, what compensating control exists

### Access Control (CC6.1)

**Status**: Partial
**Current State**: SSO implemented for SaaS apps, but AWS console access uses shared credentials for 3 service accounts
**Target State**: Individual IAM users with MFA for all human access, service accounts with scoped roles
**Remediation**:
1. Create individual IAM users for the 3 shared accounts
2. Enable MFA enforcement via SCP
3. Rotate existing credentials
**Effort**: 2 days
**Priority**: Critical — auditors will flag this immediately
